Preambule 



# School conveners 


# Collaborative Research Projects

This year we piloted collaborative research projects as part of a curriculum. We were very fortunate to partner with Ori Cloud who provided GPU compute resources. The main project 
was devoted to developing a data processing pipeline to adopt LLM for opinion prediction task. Models and datasets developed during the workshop we have uploaded to Oxford LLMs hub at Huggingface. The paper is currently being refined before submission to a target conference. 

According to participant feedback, working on a project was very rewarding and provided great hands on experience on model development. We are certainly going to build on this experience in the future :)
