## Program Overview

The Oxford LLMs Program is a five-day workshop that combines lectures, coding sessions, collaborative projects, and guest talks. Participants learn how large language models work, how to adapt them to new domains, how to evaluate them, and how to deploy them safely and fairly.

## Daily Structure

Each day follows the same four-part structure:

1. **Lecture (90 min):** Core concepts and methods  
2. **Coding Session (90 min):** Hands-on exercises using Python and Jupyter notebooks  
3. **Collaborative Research (120 min):** Small teams work on a real research question, aiming for a peer-review write-up  
4. **Guest Talk (60 min):** A social scientist presents their LLM research and answers questions  

## Main Topics

### 1) Foundations of LLMs

- Training objectives for language models  
- Transformer architecture and in-context learning  
- Model reasoning and emergent capabilities  

### 2) Adapting LLMs to Specific Domains

- Post-training methods (continued pre-training, fine-tuning)  
- Data selection and annotation strategies  
- Tooling for rapid domain adaptation  

### 3) Evaluating Language Models

- Classic tests (e.g., Turing-style probes)  
- Benchmarks for generalization and robustness  
- Metrics for real-world performance and reliability  

### 4) Safety and Fairness in LLMs

- Bias detection and mitigation techniques  
- Alignment strategies (instruction tuning, RLHF)  
- Ethical and societal considerations in deployment  

## What You Will Gain

- A clear understanding of transformer-based LLMs  
- Practical experience with state-of-the-art tools and libraries  
- Hands-on research skills in computational social science  
- Insight into current LLM applications in political science and related fields  

## Preparation

Participants should be ready to code in Python and have familiarity with basic NLP concepts. All materials, datasets, and example code will be provided ahead of time.

> For anyone who needs a refresher on the basics, we also provide a short [self-study pack of readings and coding exercises](https://llmsforsocialscience.net/preliminaries/) to complete before the workshop. {: .prompt-info }
