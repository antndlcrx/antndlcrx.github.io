Lena is a Research Scientist at [FAIR (Meta AI)](https://ai.meta.com/), where she works on Analysis and Interpretability for NLP. She is also the creator of the [**NLP Course For You**](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html) and the current president of [SIGREP](https://www.sigrep.org/) (Special Interest Group on Representation Learning at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)). Prior to her current role, Lena completed her Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh, where she was supervised by Ivan Titov and Rico Sennrich. During her Ph.D., Lena was awarded the [Facebook PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2020/01/announcing-the-recipients-of-the-2020-facebook-fellowship-awards/). She is passionate about teaching and has written several [blog posts](https://lena-voita.github.io/posts.html) on the topic.

Ilya is an applied Deep Learning Scientist with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). He currently works as the NLP lead at Wayfair in Berlin. His main professional interests include information retrieval, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and generative AI. In addition to his applied research work, Ilya has extensive experience in teaching and public speaking. He designed lectures and machine-learning bootcamps for various audiences, including students, managers, and individuals without prior coding experience. Ilya was a speaker at several ML conferences in Europe, including [World Data Summit](https://worlddatasummit.com/) and [DSC Europe](https://datasciconference.com/). He is also a co-founder of the [Street Smart AI community](https://www.meetup.com/street-smart-ai-berlin-meetup/) in Berlin where AI practitioners share their knowledge of making ML&DS happen for real-life applications.

### Maksim Zubok (Organiser)

Maksim is a DPhil candidate in Politics at Oxford University, [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/). His scholarly pursuits revolve around harnessing the potential of deep learning algorithms to explore and unravel intricate social science phenomena. In his reaseach, Maksim uses large language models to derive fine-grained measures of people's preferences for global governance from social media data. Maksim has a longstanding interest in teaching and facilitating intellectual exchange. He has helped organise several academic events, including [the Oxford Summer Institute for Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/2022/oxford/) in 2022.
