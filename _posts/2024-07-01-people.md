![talk1](/assets/img/speakers/alexis_palmer.png){: width="170" .w-10 .right}

### **Alexis Palmer**

*Neukom Fellow, Dartmouth College*

Dr Alexis Palmer recently finished her PhD at the Wilf Family Department of Politics at New York University. She will be starting as a Neukom Fellow at Dartmouth College in Fall 2024. Her dissertation focuses on institutional trust, storytelling, and natural language processing methods, but these serve mainly as the nexus points of many research interests.
The central theme of much of her work is trust: why do people trust the institutions, leaders, and information that they do. This work is rarely focused on the actual performance of these dimensions and instead asks what shapes perceptions and persuades. This interest has led her to focus on micro-founded data and individual level analysis, with a particular interest in Text as Data as a way to operationalize difficult to measure concepts such as what makes a story. The actual topics she works on have spanned conflict governance, cynicism in politics, and the role of Large Language Models.
She holds a BA in International Affairs and a BS in Mathematics from Northeastern University. Before coming to NYU, she held a wide variety of jobs including (but not limited to): project manager at the Global Resilience Institute, intern at INTERPOL’s Counterterrorism Division, seasonal farm worker, and semi-professional dancer.

### **Iverina Ivanova**
she/her

*Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer in Linguistics, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main*

Iverina has been a research associate at the linguistic unit of the Institute for English and American Studies at Goethe University since 2017. Her research interests include discourse structure and analysis, linguistic alternations from a corpus-based perspective, distributional semantics, and automated annotation and retrieval of linguistic features with state-of-the-art NLP frameworks. In her current research, she investigates the alternation between "that" and "to" complement clauses with future-oriented verbs such as "expect" and "promise". Her aim is to determine what syntactic and psycholinguistic factors influence the speaker's preference for a structure when confronted with a choice. In her previous research, she analyzed the interaction between the intentional and linguistic structures of the section types in research articles and identified section-feature associations. Apart from her linguistic endeavors, Iverina is interested in the role of LLMs in academia for research and teaching. In particular, she is eager to learn how to train an LLM on domain-specific texts(e.g., the syntax of Germanic languages) and turn it into a syntax expert with which students can interact and thus, improve their understanding of syntax.

![p1](/assets/img/participants/elena_sirotkina.jpg){: width="170" .w-10 .right}

### **Lena Sirotkina** 
she/her

*Ph.D. Candidate, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill*

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science, where I specialize in computational political behavior. My research integrates machine learning methods with experimental design to explain behavioral phenomena, particularly in the realm of visual information processing. I focus on developing computer vision classifiers that predict attitudinal outcomes, with a current emphasis on how individuals interpret and respond to political imagery. The goal is to understand the influence of visual perceptions on political attitudes and decision-making and to integrate them into the labeling and training processes. Ultimately, I am interested in improving the accuracy and complexity of models that predict human-like perceptual judgments at scale. For instance, I apply this approach to developing a visual sentiment classifier that predicts sentiment based on the perspectives of relevant social cleavages, addressing differences in vision and perception that might otherwise lead to mislabeling. In my research, I try to carefully borrow from computer science, political science, psychology, and neuroscience, bringing their perspectives together to create more reliable models. I will be on the job market next year. Here is my [website](https://elenasirotkina.rocks/)

Having participated in AI workshops at both Peking University and Cambridge, Ruoci is also interested in the intersection of AI and the humanities, seeking to apply modern technology to deepen the understanding of classical literature.

### **Faye-Marie Vassel**


*STEM Equity and Inclusion Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Stanford University GSE & HAI*

Faye-Marie Vassel is a native of the Bronx, NY and received her B.S. from Stony Brook University where she studied biochemistry and Russian studies. Following her undergraduate studies at Stony Brook Faye-Marie went on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she received her Ph.D. in biology. Faye-Marie’s doctoral research was focused on enhancing the field’s understanding of how DNA-damage response mechanisms can modulate chemotherapeutic resistance in drug-resistant lung cancer. Prior to her time at Stanford, Faye-Marie was an AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow in the Directorate for STEM Education at the National Science Foundation.

Currently, Faye-Marie is a STEM Equity and Inclusion Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford  University in the groups of Dr. Bryan Brown (GSE) and Dr. Hideo Mabuchi (Applied Physics/ HAI).  Faye-Marie’s postdoctoral research is broadly centered on investigating how learners from groups historically marginalized in STEM experience and navigate and perceive the norms and practices of Computational Science academic domains.   Faye-Marie’s primary research efforts have been devoted to studies focused on  elucidating factors  that may contribute to  pervasive inequities impacting the “techno-experiences” of learners from intersectionally marginalized social groups.  With research of this nature, Faye-Marie's long term goal is to help advance a critical understanding of mechanisms driving  these inequities;  as doing so holds the potential to develop interventions capable of mitigating the  detrimental impacts that these factors may have on  impacting the liklihood of equitable “techno-futures” of learners from these diverse social groups.

### **Chuyao Wang**

He/him/his

*PhD Candidate in Social Research Methods (Computational and Experimental Social Science), London School of Economics and Political Science*

Chuyao Wang's research interests lie at the intersection of computational social science, public opinion, human-computer interaction, and the societal impacts of LLMs. His working paper investigates the potential of socially aligned prompt engineering in ChatGPT to promote social good through a combination of computational analysis and a personalized experiment, aiming for a high-impact publication. He is also examining how institutional logics shape collaboration dynamics when integrating fine-tuned LLMs in government services. For his PhD project, he conducted a digital survey experiment to assess the impact of LLM authorship disclosure on political advertisements in shaping key social debates. His collaborative work on governance strategies in algorithmic social networks is currently under Revise & Resubmit at a Nature portfolio journal. His interdisciplinary research has been supported by the LSE Research and Impact Support Fund (£4,817), OpenAI’s Researcher Access Program (US$5,000 in credits), and a SCISS Research Grant.

### **Chenzi Xu**

*Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow, University of Oxford*

Dr Chenzi Xu is a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Oxford. She earned her D.Phil. (Ph.D.) in Linguistics from the University of Oxford. Previously, she worked as a research associate in forensic phonetics at the University of York, specialising in on automatic speaker recognition.

Chenzi’s research interests are in phonetics, sociophonetics, language variation, speech and language technology (particularly with applications to low-resource languages). Her recent work focuses on quantitative analysis of natural speech in tone languages, with a perspective to understanding systematic phonetic variation and its implications for linguistic theory.
