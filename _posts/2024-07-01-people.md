*DPIR Oxford University*

Humeyra Biricik is the co-organizer of the Oxford LLMs 2024 and a doctoral candidate in Politics at Pembroke College. Her research focuses on the relationship between political speech, populism, and democratic backsliding in Turkey, Hungary, India, and Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern countries. She primarily employs large language models and text analysis, along with other econometric analyses, to conduct her studies. She is the recipient of the joint scholarship between Pembroke and the Department of Political Science and International Relations. As a part of her scholarship, Humeyra coordinates a series of politics talks at Pembroke College, on a wide array of topics, including [local British elections](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/local-elections-and-beyond-panel), [the housing crisis](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/dpir-key-panel-discussion-address-uk-housing-crisis), [regulation of AI and democracy](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/towards-effective-regulation-ai-misinformation-and-democratic-challenges), and [machine learning methods used in political science](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/event/fall-machines-why-simple-models-work-disappointingly-well-and-what-do-about-it-politics).

### Maksim Zubok (Organiser)

*DPIR Oxford University*

Maksim is a doctoral candidate in Politics at Oxford University, [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/maksim-zubok/). In his dissertation, Maksim explores various ways of harnessing LLMs for social science research. Those range from classic data labelling to using the models as condensed snapshots of the internet from which we can learn how people organise relationships between concepts and thus form beliefs about the world they live in. Maksim has a longstanding interest in teaching and facilitating intellectual exchange. He has helped organise several academic events, including [the Oxford Summer Institute for Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/2022/oxford/) in 2022.

![sem1](/assets/img/speakers/atita_arora.jpg){: .w-75 .shadow .rounded-50 }

### Atita Arora (Seminar)

*Solution Architect, Qdrant*

Atita Arora is a seasoned and esteemed professional in information retrieval systems and has decoded complex business challenges, pioneering innovative information retrieval solutions in her 15-year journey as a Solution Architect / Relevance strategist / Individual Contributor and works as Solution Architect at Qdrant. She has a robust background from her impactful contributions as a committer in various information retrieval projects and is currently writing a book on Vector databases. She has a keen interest in making revolutionary tech innovations accessible and implementable to solve real-world problems. She is currently actively researching about evaluating RAGs while navigating the world of vectors and LLMs, seeking to uncover insights that can enhance their practical applications and effectiveness.

Atita will deliver a seminar on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG has become a cornerstone for integrating domain-specific content and addressing hallucinations in AI applications. As the adoption of RAG solutions intensifies across industries, a pressing challenge emerges: understanding and identifying where within the complex RAG framework changes and improvements can be made. This course delves into the practical ways to implement RAG through various methodologies and extracting crucial indicators from your RAG pipeline, empowering informed decision-making during experimentation. Join us as we navigate an end-to-end process for RAG implementation, experimentation, and evaluation, offering insights into optimizing performance and addressing hurdles along the RAG implementation journey.
Through an end-to-end process for RAG implementation, experimentation, and evaluation, the aim is to offer actionable insights for optimizing performance and overcoming implementation hurdles. Attendees and viewers can expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to refine their RAG solutions for maximum impact
