## Humeyra Biricik (Co-organizer)

*DPIR Oxford University*

Humeyra Biricik is the co-organizer of the Oxford LLMs 2024 and a doctoral candidate in Politics at Pembroke College. Her research focuses on the relationship between political speech, populism, and democratic backsliding in Turkey, Hungary, India, and Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern countries. She primarily employs large language models and text analysis, along with other econometric analyses, to conduct her studies. She is the recipient of the joint scholarship between Pembroke and the Department of Political Science and International Relations. As a part of her scholarship, Humeyra coordinates a series of politics talks at Pembroke College, on a wide array of topics, including [local British elections](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/local-elections-and-beyond-panel), [the housing crisis](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/dpir-key-panel-discussion-address-uk-housing-crisis), [regulation of AI and democracy](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/event/towards-effective-regulation-ai-misinformation-and-democratic-challenges), and [machine learning methods used in political science](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/event/fall-machines-why-simple-models-work-disappointingly-well-and-what-do-about-it-politics). She is currently working on organizing writing workshops for undergraduate students in politics, to support women and ethnic minority undergraduates at Oxford University.

As the adoption of RAG solutions intensifies across industries, a pressing challenge emerges: understanding and identifying where within the complex RAG framework changes and improvements can be made. This course delves into the practical ways to implement RAG through various methodologies and extracting crucial indicators from your RAG pipeline, empowering informed decision-making during experimentation. Join us as we navigate an end-to-end process for RAG implementation, experimentation, and evaluation, offering insights into optimizing performance and addressing hurdles along the RAG implementation journey.
Through an end-to-end process for RAG implementation, experimentation, and evaluation, the aim is to offer actionable insights for optimizing performance and overcoming implementation hurdles. Attendees and viewers can expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to refine their RAG solutions for maximum impact

# Research Talk Speakers

### Alexis Palmer

*Neukom Fellow, Dartmouth College*

Dr Alexis Palmer recently finished her PhD at the Wilf Family Department of Politics at New York University. She will be starting as a Neukom Fellow at Dartmouth College in Fall 2024. Her dissertation focuses on institutional trust, storytelling, and natural language processing methods, but these serve mainly as the nexus points of many research interests.
The central theme of much of her work is trust: why do people trust the institutions, leaders, and information that they do. This work is rarely focused on the actual performance of these dimensions and instead asks what shapes perceptions and persuades. This interest has led her to focus on micro-founded data and individual level analysis, with a particular interest in Text as Data as a way to operationalize difficult to measure concepts such as what makes a story. The actual topics she works on have spanned conflict governance, cynicism in politics, and the role of Large Language Models.
She holds a BA in International Affairs and a BS in Mathematics from Northeastern University. Before coming to NYU, she held a wide variety of jobs including (but not limited to): project manager at the Global Resilience Institute, intern at INTERPOL’s Counterterrorism Division, seasonal farm worker, and semi-professional dancer.

### Alison Koh

*Research Fellow in NLP, The University of Birmingham’s Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government*

Allison Koh holds a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University and a PhD from [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/profile/person/allison-koh). She is currently a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government. 

Her research interests lie at the intersection of international relations, political communication, and computational social science, with a focus on the geopolitics of emerging technologies and applications of generative AI in conflict research. In her dissertation, Allison outlined the strategic landscape of digital transnational repression on social media and identified how vulnerabilities in social media companies’ transparency and content moderation policies benefit the foreign policy interests of authoritarian regimes.


### Thomas Hegghammer

*Senior Fellow in Politics, All Souls College, Oxford University*

Dr. Thomas Hegghammer is Senior Fellow in Politics at All Souls College, Oxford University. He is a political scientist and historian who works on political violence in the Muslim world, especially transnational jihadi groups.
