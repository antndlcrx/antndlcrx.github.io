Rapid advancements in LLMs offer exciting new opportunities for social science applications. However, it is crucial to address the limitations of these models, including their propensity to hallucinate, propagate social biases, and occasionally provide false information. The primary goal of the Oxford LLMs workshop is to promote the responsible and effective use of LLMs in social science research.


## Workshop Structure: 
The workshop is divided into two main parts - the Instruction part and Collaborative Research part.

### Instruction (Monday 23 Sept - Wednesday 25 Sept)

Every day, we start with a technical lecture offering a deep dive into the functioning of modern LLMs, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. After a lunch break, we continue with practical coding sessions: these will provide you with the skills and tools needed to effectively use LLMs in your research. In the afternoon, we conclude with a research talk or panel during which invited social science researchers will share their ongoing projects at the intersections of social science and natural language processing (NLP).


### Collaborative Research Projects (active phase: Thursday 26 - Friday 27 September)
Participants and school conveners will engage in collaborative research projects that aim to result in peer-reviewed publications.
These projects will start online slightly before the workshop, intensify during the final two days, and continue afterward.

The focus will be on interdisciplinary projects that lie at the intersection of NLP and social sciences.
By the end of the workshop, attendees will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to integrate LLMs responsibly and effectively into their social science research, fostering innovative and ethical applications.
