**Meet Oxford LLMs 2025 Team!**

Here, you will find information about our organisers and lecturers who are leading this year's sessions. Beyond the core sessions, we are also inviting researchers and research teams to come and share with you their current research ideas and projects at the intersection of NLP and social sciences. Stay tuned, as we will be updating this page with additional speakers as we receive their confirmations!

### **Rachel Bernhard (Co-Organiser)**


Rachel Bernhard is Associate Professor of Quantitative Political Science Research Methods at Nuffield College and the University of Oxford. Before joining Nuffield, she served as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis. She holds a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley, and previously was a Postdoctoral Prize Fellow in Politics at Nuffield.

Her current research focuses on appearance-based discrimination in politics. She has recently taught courses on political psychology and public policy, identity politics, statistics and research design, women in politics, and computational methods.

### **Ilya Boytsov (Lecturer, Co-organiser)**

*NLP Lead, Wayfair*

Ilya is an applied Deep Learning Scientist with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). He currently works as the NLP lead at Wayfair in Berlin. His main professional interests include information retrieval, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and generative AI. In addition to his applied research work, Ilya has extensive experience in teaching and public speaking. He designed lectures and machine-learning bootcamps for various audiences, including students, managers, and individuals without prior coding experience. Ilya was a speaker at several ML conferences in Europe, including [World Data Summit](https://worlddatasummit.com/) and [DSC Europe](https://datasciconference.com/). He is also a co-founder of the [Street Smart AI community](https://www.meetup.com/street-smart-ai-berlin-meetup/) in Berlin where AI practitioners share their knowledge of making ML&DS happen for real-life applications. You can connect with Ilya and read more about his research on his [personal website](https://ieboytsov.github.io/about-me.html). 


![org3](/assets/img/speakers/maksim_zubok.png){: width="170" .w-10 .right}

### **Maksim Zubok (Co-Organiser)**

*DPIR Oxford University*

Maksim is a doctoral candidate in Politics at Oxford University, [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/maksim-zubok/). In his dissertation, Maksim explores various ways of harnessing LLMs for social science research. Those range from classic data labelling to using the models as condensed snapshots of the internet from which we can learn how people organise relationships between concepts and thus form beliefs about the world they live in. Maksim has a longstanding interest in teaching and facilitating intellectual exchange. He has helped organise several academic events, including previous sessions of Oxford LLM workshop and [the Oxford Summer Institute for Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/2022/oxford/) in 2022.
