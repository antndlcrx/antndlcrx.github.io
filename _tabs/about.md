# Oxford Large Language Models for Social Science Workshop 

Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionising social science research with their exceptional text comprehension capabilities, opening new avenues for innovation. However, LLMs can introduce social biases into the output, and the reliability of their outputs can vary. Safely and responsibly harnessing LLMs while fostering innovation requires specialised trainingâ€”a challenging task given the rapid pace of LLM research, with new models and updates emerging weekly.

Oxford LLMs addresses these challenges by uniting machine learning scientists, leading researchers, and industry practitioners to offer comprehensive training to social scientists. Our goal is to bridge the gap between academia and industry, as well as between social sciences and computer science, with a focus on natural language processing. Our workshop equips participants with the latest skills and fosters a community that promotes innovation in social science research, ensuring the safe and responsible use of LLMs.
