## Eligibility
Participation is restricted to postgraduate students, including masters, doctoral and early career researchers (within 3 years of PhD completion). You should be familiar with basic concepts in natural language processing (word embeddings) and be comfortable working with python^footnote1. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study within social sciences.

> We strongly encourage applications from those identifying with underrepresented groups in academia, NLP, and tech.

We are expecting to invite about 30 participants. You will be expected to fully attend, participate and engage in the entire workshop program. We will be providing you with a sandwich lunch and coffee break refreshments. Unfortunately, we cannot offer you accommodation, but will send around a list of hotels, colleges, and hostels where you can find affordable accommodation.
