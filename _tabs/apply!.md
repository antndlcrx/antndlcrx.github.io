Hello there,

If you're an early career researcher — master’s, PhD student, postdoc, or even an early career professor — join us for a hands-on five-day workshop focused on Large Language Models in Social Sciences happening **22–26 September**.

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to postgraduate students, including master’s, doctoral, and early career researchers (within 3 years of PhD completion). You should be familiar with basic concepts in natural language processing (word embeddings) and be comfortable working with Python[^1]. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study within social sciences and AI research.

> We strongly encourage applications from those identifying with underrepresented groups in academia, NLP, and tech.  
{: .prompt-tip }

We are expecting to invite about 30 participants. You will be expected to fully attend, participate, and engage in the entire workshop program. We will be providing you with lunch and coffee break refreshments. Unfortunately, we cannot offer you accommodation, but will send around a list of hotels, colleges, and hostels where you can find affordable options.

> We are offering ten scholarships of **up to £400** to reimburse travel and subsistence expenses (including accommodation) to participants travelling from outside of Oxford.

> Applications close on `22 July 2025` ⏰  
{: .prompt-warning }

We will notify all applicants of the outcome on Thursday `28 July 2025`.

[^1]: If you are new to Python or unsure about your grasp of basic NLP concepts, we still encourage you to apply. You will just need to complete some extra preparation before the workshop. We’ve compiled a [list of preliminaries](https://llmsforsocialscience.net/preliminaries/) that you are welcome to review.
